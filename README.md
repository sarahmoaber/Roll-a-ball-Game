# Roll-a-ball-Game

This is what is required of this project

Edit “Roll-A-Ball” game:<br>
1- Instead of deactivating the pickups, change their material to a new material with a different
color. (Hint: Look up Renderer in the manual).<br>
2- Make the ball grow larger each time it collects a cube. (Hint: look up “radius” or
“Transform.localscale” in the manual).<br>
3- Add an extra object. When the player collects this object, they get ten points instead of one
point and a message appears saying “You got 10 more points!”.<br>
4- As a challenge for the player: if the player hits one wall, a message appears saying “Careful!
You hit one wall. If you hit all four you will lose!” Then the color of that wall changes and if it
was hit again nothing happens. If the player hits the second wall, a message appears saying
“Careful! You hit a second wall. If you hit all four you will lose!” Then the color of that wall
changes and if it was hit again nothing happens. Do this for the other two walls. If the player
hits the fourth wall, they will lose and a message saying “YOU LOST” will appear.
